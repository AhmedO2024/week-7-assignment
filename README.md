# week-7-assignment

I have tried to meet all the user requirements and a few of stretch goals like the below:

- As a user, I want to access different posts through dynamic pages so that navigation feels smooth.
- As a user, I want to explore posts by category using dedicated routes so that I can easily find content that interests me.
- As a user, I want to be able to delete my posts so that I can manage my content and remove anything I no longer want to share.

The ones I couldn't meet was the liking the posts and filtering the posts. Overall I have improved my work form my previous projects and build the mono repo with React.

P.S The screenshot of the database schema is in the components folder.
